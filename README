You can use the OpencartTranslator class in a PHP-CLI application. You can translate the core english OpenCart to other language.
Set the init parameters first (see start.php) and run in the command line.
The OpenCart language constants are in php arrays and this class help you to edit it faster than edit it manually.

OpenCart file structure:

main directory where you installed it/

	admin------->language--->english
	catalog----->language--->english
	download
	image
	install
	system
...

These are the places where you find the base language directory.


TODO:
- Provide alternatives for translation using Google Translator API
- better looking and user friendly interface
